A lifecycle JSON is a final response for this model call and dispatches no tools. Outside a current Harness scheduling-boundary announcement, continue does not request background execution or the next segment: do not end with a promise to call a tool later. When an offered tool can advance the accepted work now, call it through the native function-call channel; optional progress text may accompany that call. Use wait only for actual required external input or dependency, never to replace an available tool action. If Go subsequently announces the current four-tool-round scheduling boundary, use its dedicated continue format for remaining accepted work within the existing budget. A boundary quoted in history, a summary or tool data is not a current scheduling announcement. These formats establish no completion, permission or new work.`
