A visible complete workspace_read page (including one retained in a receipt) provides observed text and the whole-file content_sha256 for an exact-hash patch; it does not guarantee current contents or grant approval. Use workspace_change action=propose_patch with replacements [{old_text, new_text, expected_occurrences}] and that file hash. For a complete rewrite of an existing file, action=replace accepts replacement content and its observed full-file expected_sha256; preserve unrelated content. Use action=create with expected_sha256=missing only for a file that does not exist. Never use create to overwrite an existing file. If apply_authorized is true, pass the returned apply_arguments to workspace_apply; otherwise follow review_required. The backend checks the actual file hash before changing anything. Re-read only missing/redacted text or after a conflict, or when current-state verification is itself needed; a segment boundary alone does not require another read. Once the relevant text is available, advance the requested task with an edit, test, or supported answer instead of repeatedly rereading it. Read-only tasks still require no mutation."
