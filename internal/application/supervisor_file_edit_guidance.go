This describes eligibility when the tools were advertised, not an approval or a guarantee that authority remains live. Go rechecks the current scope, permission, lease and file hashes at execution; a newer denial takes precedence over this snapshot. If the user requested a file change, workspace_change can prepare its proposal before per-file review exists; the proposal itself does not write bytes. Do not ask the user to approve a proposal you have not prepared. Read the resulting apply_authorized and review_required flags, and use its apply_arguments only when authorized. Historical failed or unknown effects describe those earlier calls; they establish neither current permission nor revocation. They do not by themselves prevent preparing a new proposal. Read-only tasks still require no edits."
